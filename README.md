- **Customer/Supplier Update Screen:** Form to update existing customers or suppliers.

## Architecture

The app follows the Clean Architecture principles combined with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase.

### Layers

1. **Presentation Layer:**
   - **UI:** Contains all the UI code and widgets.
   - **ViewModel:** Manages the state and handles user interactions, communicating with the domain layer.

2. **Domain Layer:**
   - **Entities:** Basic data objects used across the application.
   - **Use Cases:** Encapsulates business logic and interacts with the repository to fetch/update data.

3. **Data Layer:**
   - **Models:** Data models for API responses.
   - **Repositories:** Interfaces defining data operations.
   - **Data Sources:** Implements data operations, fetching data from network or local database.

### MVVM Pattern

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic.
- **View:** Displays the data (UI).
- **ViewModel:** Acts as a mediator between the Model and the View, handling presentation logic and state management.
